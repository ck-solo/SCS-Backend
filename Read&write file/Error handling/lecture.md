How to store value in variable
so basically like
localhost:3000/data/user/name
localhost:3000/data/user/id
localhost:3000/data/user/post
in the given url there are line
localhost:3000/data/user is repeating so we can store it in a varible by giving it a name like basicurl to do it 
we just select and select varibale and then gave it a name and when we need to use it just in url section we need to write the name in braces {{basicUrl}}id
and it show id
